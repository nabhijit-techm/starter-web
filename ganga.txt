The Ganges is one of the most sacred rivers to Hindus.[4] It is also a lifeline to millions of Indians who live along its course and depend on it for their daily needs. It is worshipped in Hinduism and personified as the goddess Gaṅgā.[5] It has also been important historically, with many former provincial or imperial capitals (such as [6] Kannauj, Kampilya, Kanpur,[6] Kara, Prayag or Allahabad, Kashi, Pataliputra or Patna, Hajipur, Munger, Bhagalpur, Baranagar, Murshidabad, Baharampur, Nabadwip, Saptagram and Kolkata) located on its banks.
